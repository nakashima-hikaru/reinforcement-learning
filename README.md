# Reinforcement Learning Project

This project is a modern rewrite of
the [deep-learning-from-scratch-4](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-4), focusing on
implementing reinforcement learning algorithms using contemporary Python development practices. The design has been
carefully crafted to incorporate object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and implementation of interfaces. This
project was created as part of my personal journey to understand reinforcement learning in-depth.

## Technologies Used

- **Poetry:** Used for dependency management. It allows the maintenance of cleaner code and makes the project more
  maintainable.
- **pytest:** Utilized for running tests and ensuring the code operates as intended.
- **mypy:** Deployed for optional static typing, which assists in detecting and resolving potential errors during the
  development phase of the code.
- **Ruff:** Applied as both a formatter and linter for this project. It helps in maintaining clean, readable and
  consistent code, while also identifying and signalling potential error-causing issues in the code.
